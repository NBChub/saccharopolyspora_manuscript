The comparison of BGCs against BiG-FAM-DB can be used to investigate if detected BGCs are widely spread across other genomes from the public datasets. The BiG-SLICE-based query resulted in 391 BGCs having similarities against 131 GCF models from the BiGFAM database. From the 131 detected GCFs, there were 72 BiG-FAM GCFs that are specifically distributed in the genus Saccharopolyspora. Whereas several other GCFs included BGCs from different genera such as Streptomyces (47 genomes), Amycolatopsis (31 genomes), Kitasatospora (29 genomes), Nocardia (25 genomes), Pseudomonas_E (22 genomes), and many others. We further calculated the Shannon diversity index (H) for each of the GCFs representing the distribution of BGCs across different genera (Figure 4b). Of the 59 GCFs with positive Shannon index, 33 were highly distributed across many genera with a Shannon index of greater than 2. The GCF GCF_201888 with the lowest positive Shannon index (~0.3) contained 12444 BGCs distributed across 43 genera with the majority belonging to Staphylococcus (94.2%)) followed by Acinetobacter (4.3%). The known BGC in this BiG-FAM GCF coded for the biosynthesis of staphylobactin (also known as staphyloferrin B), which is a siderophore with a role in the virulence of Staphylococcus aureus (84, 85). The detailed comparative analysis of the predicted BGCs against the MIBIG entry showed that the Saccharopolypora genomes indeed possess a BGC that is very similar to the staphylobactin BGC from Staphylococcus aureus (Figure S11). Some of the other GCFs like GCF_215691 (Shannon index: 0.35), GCF_220008 (Shannon index: 0.41), and GCF_203048 (Shannon index: 0.52) were found predominantly in genera such as Pseudomonas_E (1241 genomes), Mycobacterium (227 genomes), and Streptomyces (114 genomes), respectively (Figure 4B). These examples particularly highlight the BGCs that are potentially transferred across different phylogenetic groups through horizontal gene transfer events.
