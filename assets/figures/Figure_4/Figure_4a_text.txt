Here, various genome mining tools were used to predict BGCs and their association with databases such as MIBIG, BiGFAM-DB, and ARTS. The predicted mappings of BGCs against these different databases were used to reconstruct a treemap distribution (Figure 4a). Using antiSMASH, a total of 724 BGCs were predicted across 26 Saccharopolyspora genomes with a median of 25 BGCs per genome. The BGCs were distributed across various types such as Saccharides (8 BGCs), PKS-NRP_Hybrids (37 BGCs), PKSI (45 BGCs), PKSother (60 BGCs), NRPS (82 BGCs), RiPPs (90 BGCs), Terpene (159 BGCs), and Others (243 BGCs). Based on the antiSMASH KnownClusterBlast similarity of greater than 80%, a total of 122 BGCs were mapped to the 16 MIBIG database entries of characterized secondary metabolites. Most common hits were geosmin (31 BGCs), ectoine (26 BGCs), 2-methylisoborneol (15 BGCs), and erythreapeptin (14 BGCs) which were found across multiple species. Whereas erythromycin (5 BGCs), flaviolin (5 BGCs), erythrochelin (5 BGCs), spinosyn (5 BGCs), and E-837 furanone (4 BGCs) were detected in specific species.
