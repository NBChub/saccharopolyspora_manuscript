In the integrated BiG-SCAPE network with (0.40 cutoff), there are 980 nodes and 2575 edges.
From these, 724 are BGCs, 19 are MIBIG entries identified with BiG-SCAPE, and 139 are MIBIG entries identified with KnownClusterBlast.
In these network, there are 190 connected components (GCFs), with 97 singleton BGCs (41 true singletons). 
Of these, there are 609 BGCs that belongs to 126 GCFs with similariy to MIBIG nodes.
