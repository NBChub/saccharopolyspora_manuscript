In the BiG-SCAPE network with (0.40 cutoff), there are 743 nodes and 1698 edges.
From these, 724 are BGCs, 19 are MIBIG entries identified with BiG-SCAPE, and 0 are MIBIG entries identified with KnownClusterBlast.
In these network, there are 280 connected components (GCFs), with 164 singleton BGCs (162 true singletons). 
Of these, there are 80 BGCs that belongs to 10 GCFs with similariy to MIBIG nodes.
