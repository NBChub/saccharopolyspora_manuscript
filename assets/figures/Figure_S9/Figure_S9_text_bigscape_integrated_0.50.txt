In the integrated BiG-SCAPE network with (0.50 cutoff), there are 1059 nodes and 3080 edges.
From these, 724 are BGCs, 110 are MIBIG entries identified with BiG-SCAPE, and 127 are MIBIG entries identified with KnownClusterBlast.
In these network, there are 173 connected components (GCFs), with 83 singleton BGCs (36 true singletons). 
Of these, there are 610 BGCs that belongs to 114 GCFs with similariy to MIBIG nodes.
