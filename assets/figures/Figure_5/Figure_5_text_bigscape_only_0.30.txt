In the BiG-SCAPE network with (0.30 cutoff), there are 730 nodes and 1217 edges.
From these, 724 are BGCs, 6 are MIBIG entries identified with BiG-SCAPE, and 0 are MIBIG entries identified with KnownClusterBlast.
In these network, there are 328 connected components (GCFs), with 207 singleton BGCs (206 true singletons). 
Of these, there are 14 BGCs that belongs to 4 GCFs with similariy to MIBIG nodes.
